# Swift Background Store

Still a prototype and work in progress.

The idea is to have a Redux Store for Swift which is similar to [The Composable Architecture](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture), but used for storing non-UI states on background threads. 

See [the example in Tests](Tests/BackgroundStore/BackgroundStoreTests.swift) to see how it works.
